It was slow. So slow. Time to wake up from your naps and re-cap, people: Ariana Grande kicked off this particularly emo Grammys with a heart-wrenching did we mention slow? rendition of her Just a Little Bit of Your Heart. And then Kanye West returned to the Grammys stage to perform for the first time in six years and delivered the auto-tuned emo-rap Only One, which he performed in the dark, with just a single light shining up from the stage. (Those who managed to catch his 2013-2014 Yeezus tour should recognize the aesthetic.) The performer had two songs slated for the Grammys, including an upcoming group performance of the song FourFiveSeconds with Paul McCartney and Rihanna. McCartney also appeared on Only One, but didnt perform the track with West at the ceremony.

Ed Sheeran with John Mayer and Questlove got all bromantic with Thinking Out Loud, and by that point, it was hard to open your eyes long enough to watch Adam Levine and Gwen Stefani deliver their emotional duet, My Heart is Open (written by Sia). Even Pharrell performed a performance-art take on Happy, which rendered the song, and those watching at home, rather unhappy. (Media outlets including Billboard and the Huffington Post later reported that the dancers were clad in hoodies as a reference to Trayvon Martin and that used the Hands up, dont shoot gesture common among protesters after the killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson.) We never thought wed say it, but thank goodness for ELO. If it was part of some grand strategy to make the three-hour-plus ceremony feel like a full seven-hour affair, well, Grammys, you won.
