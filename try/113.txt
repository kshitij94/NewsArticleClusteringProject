A large sinkhole on Richmond Highway in Fairfax County has been fixed in time for Wednesday mornings rush hour, water officials said. The hole on the southbound side of the road at the Engleside Street intersection opened up Tuesday evening. It was about 2 feet long, 3 feet wide and pretty deep, according to Fairfax County police. Jeanne Bailey, a spokeswoman for Fairfax Water, said in an e-mail Wednesday morning that the water main and road are repaired and open. Crews worked overnight to fix the 6-inch water main break. The hole in the roadway caused delays in Tuesday evenings commute in that area.
