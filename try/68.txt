Weaker than expected economic reports caused a slump in mortgage rates this week, according to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac. The 30-year fixed-rate average dropped to 3.59 percent with an average 0.7 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 3.66 percent a week ago and 4.32 percent a year ago.Since December, the 30-year fixed rate has fallen 28 basis points to start the new year. The 30-year fixed rate, the most popular type of mortgage, hasnt been this favorable since May 23, 2013 when it was also 3.59 percent. That low mark came the day after the Federal Reserve talked about tapering the governments bond-buying program. The wind-down of quantitative easing sent mortgage rates soaring. The 15-year fixed-rate average fell to 2.92 percent with an average 0.6 point. It was 2.98 percent a week ago and 3.4 percent a year ago. It was the fourth week in a row the 15-year fixed rate has remained below 3 percent. Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages were mixed. The five-year ARM average sank to 2.82 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.86 percent a week ago and 3.12 percent a year ago. The one-year ARM average ticked up to 2.39 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.38 percent a week ago. Mortgage rates fell this week following the release of weaker than expected pending home sales, which fell 3.7 percent in December, Len Kiefer, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist, said in a statement. Moreover, real GDP growth for the fourth quarter was 2.6 percent and the Institute for Supply Management reported slower growth in manufacturing last month, both missing market consensus forecasts. Meanwhile, refinances drove mortgage applications up slightly last week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index, a measure of total loan application volume, increased 1.3 percent. The refinance index grew 3 percent, while the purchase index fell 2 percent. The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 71 percent of all applications.
