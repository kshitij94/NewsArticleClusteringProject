Taylor Gourmet has traded in its cheesesteaks for pizza. Pizza Parts and Service opens today at 1320 H St. NE in the space formerly occupied by Taylor Charles Steak & Ice, which closed earlier this year. Pizza Parts & Service will serve a dozen pizzas, and the menu is divided into red, white and specialty categories.Pizzas are served in both 14- and 18-inch circular varieties, or in an 18-inch rectangular "nonna," or Grandma Pizza, style. Toppings include meatballs, soppressata, broccoli rabe, bacon and Buffalo chicken (not all on one pie, unless you want it that way, of course). Wings -- including Old Bay and Sriracha varieties -- calzones, and garlic knots are also on the menu. Pizza Parts & Service joins H &pizza as the neighborhood's go-to options for late night pizza, and delivery will be launching soon. Hours are 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m. to 3:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Video: Pizza Parts and Service (NSFW audio) Pizza Parts & Service, 1320 H St. NE. 202-388-6880. @thatslice.
