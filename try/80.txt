On Tuesday morning, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform met to question Jonathan Gruber, the verbally challengedMIT economist who many conservatives hoped would prove Obamacare's kill switch. The beginning of the event proved to be a rarebipartisan moment, when the committee's chairman and ranking member agreed that Gruber -- or at least his words -- were stupid. "Night before last, I was at the Kennedy Center Honors," Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said, "where they honored Tom Hanks. Famously Forrest Gump. The ultimate in successful stupid man." He then proceeded to get to his point: "Are you stupid?" "I don't think so, no," Gruber replied, shaking his head over a name tent prominently reminding the membersthat he hasa Ph.D. Issa had a follow-up: "Does MIT employ stupid people?" Gruber shook his head. "Not to my knowledge." "Ok," Issa said. "So you're a smart man, who said some -- as the ranking member said, somereallystupid things. And you said the same. Is this correct?" Gruber agreed. "The comments I made were really inexcusable," he said. A few moments earlier, the committee's ranking member, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), said similar things. "As far as I can tell, we are here today to beat up on Jonathan Gruber, orstupid --I mean absolutelystupid --comments he made over the past few years." According to the Sunlight Foundation's Capitol Words tool, the word"stupid" has seen a enormous jump in popularity in the last month at the Capitol. It was deployed 18 times during floor speeches. Republicans favor the word more than Democrats. If you are from Texas, you are most likely to have added the word "stupid" to the Congressional Record. Much of the growth, naturally, is directly a result of elected officials talking about Gruber.
