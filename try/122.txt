Hypothetically, lets say you could go back in time to 1900 and do one thing to save millionsof lives. What would you do? Constrained to one wish, you might ask for world peace. It seems like an obvious and easy choice. But during the four deadliest wars the United States fought in the 20th century, 39 percent more Americans were dying in motor vehicles. The lesson here isnt that U.S. roadways are less safe than fighting in a war. Far more Americans were on roads than on battlefields. We dont need to give out medals of honor for driving on your local interstate. Driving to a movie theater helps just you; fighting in a war benefits your country. But whats striking from the graph above is how we discount the deaths of motor vehicle accidents. If we value all American lives, shouldnt we be obsessed with making self-driving cars a reality? While war is hell, driving sure isnt heaven. Related: Peak fender-bender: Technology can prevent car crashes, if consumers will buy in
