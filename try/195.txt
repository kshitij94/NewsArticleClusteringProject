Patty Boom Boom, the U Street nightclub known for its pounding reggae music and late-night Jamaican patties, announced over the weekend that its last day of operations will be Saturday, Feb. 21. It will be replaced by Cloak and Dagger, a nightclub that describes itself as an "Up and coming Lounge/Speak Easy" on its Facebook page. "We sold the building, and the new owner wanted to get higher rent," explained Ian Hilton. Hilton's brother Eric is one of the owners of Patty Boom Boom, along with Yama Jewayni and Farid Nouri, who are also owners of Eighteenth Street Lounge. Hilton said that there were issues with neighbors concerning noise levels at Patty Boom Boom, as well as lines of people blocking the sidewalk while waiting to get into the club, but those factors played no part in the decision to close the 5-year-old nightspot. The next few weeks are billed as "Last Call for the Dance Hall," with a special edition of the throwback party 95 Live on Feb. 12, and appearances by DJ Spyda (Feb. 14) and Selasse Sound (Feb. 20). The final party on Feb. 21 will be hosted by Federation Sound, with DJs starting at 8 p.m. Though Patty Boom Boom has less than two weeks left on U Street, it will return in pop-up form over Memorial Day weekend at Marvinand the neighboring Den of Thieves.
