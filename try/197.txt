Late yesterday, the Georgetowner broke the news that Rhino Bar is closing at the end of the month. The Georgetown bar was known as a popular student hangout, and a place to go for cheap wings and pitchers during football games. (The weekend shenanigans also earned Rhino the No. 16 spot on Complex's infamous "25 Douchiest Bars in Washington" rankings.) Beyond that, Rhino is a popular game-watching site for alumni groups (Penn State, Ohio State) and fans of pro teams (Philadelphia Eagles, Boston Red Sox). @pkcapitol Help us, @goingoutguide ! Is there a new bar for Eagles fans? Hayden Hurst (@MorePlacesToGo) February 9, 2015 Our pick in D.C. is Sign of the Whale, which has been a reliable Eagles bar for years. Deals at the M Street NW bar include $3 Yuengling and $4 Victory beers, and $10 cheesesteak platters. But with pitchers and catchers scheduled to report next week, our thoughts are with the area's Red Sox fans. Rhino Bar was a major gathering point for Red Sox Nation: The World Series trophy made an appearance at the bar following Boston's 2004 victory, and Rhino's been a place to go (or, for fans of other teams, avoid) ever since. Case in point: this 2013 video. So, Red Sox fans, where will you watch David Ortiz and company this spring? Stetson's has long been a hangout for Boston fans it, too, got a World Series trophy visit while the Ugly Mug has been known to show big games with sound. (Its location on Barracks Row makes it a popular Nationals pre-game spot, so keep that in mind.) In Arlington, Ireland's Four Courts boasts that it's "the proud home of Red Sox Nation." The availability of NESN and other sports packages makes it easier than ever to show Red Sox games from all over the country, so the vibe is more important than the number of screens.
