A pair of Senate Republicans addressed a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Wednesday morning amid tensions between GOP leaders in the two chambers over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. But the visit didn't appear to clear away the roadblocks as rank-and-file House members kept up pressure on the Senate to act, even as there is no clear path around Democratic resistance in the upper chamber. Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), two freshmen, spoke at the meeting of House Republicans in the basement of the Capitol in an apparent effort to open a dialogue between Republicans on opposite ends of the building. "They explained to us how the Senate process works and we were glad to have some of our former colleagues do that," said Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.). But he added, "From this House member's perspective, and I think that I reflect the vast majority of the members of our conference, the Senate needs to do its job. Period." Echoing that sentiment, Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) repeatedly said after the meeting that "the House has done its job." He called on Senate Democrats to "get off their ass" and allow the bill to move forward. House Republicans have passed a bill to fund DHS through September that strips money for President Obama's executive actions on immigration. Senate Democrats have repeatedly blocked the bill, and Senate GOP leaders have acknowledged that it is going nowhere in their chamber. Time is running out, and members are feeling an increased urgency to act, since current spending runs dry Feb. 27. But it's still not clear how Republicans intend to move forward. "One way or the other, we have to get the funding," said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.).
