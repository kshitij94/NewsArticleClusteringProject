Jeb Bush and his political action committee scrambled to defend their new chief technical officer, Ethan Czahor, Monday after numerous offensive posts from his inactive Twitter feed surfaced. Governor Bush believes the comments were inappropriate. They have been deleted at our request. Ethan is a great talent in the tech world and we are very excited to have him on board the Right to Rise PAC, Bush spokesperson Kristy Campbell in a statement. Time Magazine reported Monday that Bushs "Right to Rise" PAChad hired Czahor to run the former Florida governors tech operation ahead of his likely presidential run. Within minutes -- even though the campaign-in-waiting had yet to officially announce that Czahor had even joined the team -- profanity-laden tweets posted to the new CTO's account between 2009 and 2014 surfaced. The tweets in question, which included disparaging remarks about women, gays, and various celebrities, soon began to disappear from Czahors twitter feed -- but not before Buzzfeed and others grabbed screenshots and published them online. The reaction was swift.
