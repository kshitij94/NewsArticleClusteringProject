We're about to find out. On. Feb. 16,700McDonald's locations in the region will unveil a new, limited-time-only menu item: a Filet-O-Fish with the beloved Maryland seafood seasoning. According to a McDonalds press release, local owner/operatorMark Furr came up with the idea, so we can all blame him if this ruins Old Bay forever. It might not. The Filet-O-Fish isn't the chain's most popular menu item, but the fried fish sandwich with cheese and tartar sauce has a bit of a cult following. In 2010, former Saveur editor James Oseland admitted he was a fan: "Im sorry, I know it is the height of foodie irresponsibility even to admit to setting foot inside the Evil Death Star that is McDonalds, but the mega-chains Filet-O-Fish sandwiches are perfection on a bun. . .From the crisp wedge of battered, fried fish to the dainty dab of tartar sauce, they are a miracle of food science." The sandwichalso gets some rock-n-roll cred for being banned in Russia. Old Bay, meanwhile, has been popping up in beer and doughnuts and generally everything. Have we reached Peak Old Bay? Are you Lovin' It?
