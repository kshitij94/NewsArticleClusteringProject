After Robert Griffin III dislocated his ankle during the Redskins second game of the season, he had his cast signed bymost, if not all, of histeammates. Griffin subsequently put that cast up for auction, with the proceeds benefiting his charity, Family of 3. When we last wrote about this, on Jan. 12, a mere $300 had been bid, which seemed kind of a paltry amount for such an unusual, autograph-heavy item of Redskins paraphernalia. As the Family of 3 Web site points out, Notable signatures include: Alfred Morris, DeAngelo Hall, Desean Jackson, Pierre Garcon and many more. Hey, thats two of the teams four nucleus players! Well, it seems that the bidding has reached a less embarrassing number: So if you want to snag Griffins signed cast, be prepared to pony up something in the four-figure range. And, as you may have noticed from the image, be prepared to do it soon the auction is scheduled to end at 6 p.m. on Friday. Of course, if Griffin wants to whip up some more interest in the auction before it ends, he really ought topost something about it on Instagram.
