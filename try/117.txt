The Redskins announced the signings of a pair of free agent offensive linemen Tuesday, Ty Larsen and Tyler Nsekhe. Larsen, a center, went undrafted out of Utah State last year and eventually signed with the Miami Dolphins. The 6-foot-4, 315-pounder started all four years at Utah State. Nsekhe, 29, played for Texas State before playing in arenafootball2 in 2009 and the Arena Football League from 2010 to 2012. The tackle eventually signed with Indianapolis in 2012 as an undrafted free agent. The 6-8, 325-pound Nskhe had brief stints with St. Louis and New Orleans, playing in two games for the Rams in 2012.
