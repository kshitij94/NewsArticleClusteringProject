One of 10 movers from the Kane Company helps Nationals staff load the truck Monday. At 9:30 a.m. Monday morning, a truck pulling a 53-foot trailer backed its way into the loading dock that sits outside the Nationals clubhouse at Nationals Park. Spring training is just 869 miles and 10 days away. Another year, one Nationals employee said as he passed clubhouse manager Mike Wallace, extending his hand. Another year, Wallace said. The packing for this trip began in November and was due to conclude Monday afternoon, when the truck will head south down Interstate 95 to Viera, Fla., and Space Coast Stadium, where pitchers and catchers are due to report Feb. 19. Position players are due in on Feb. 24, with the first full-squad workout on Feb. 25. The truck will be packed with about 30,000 pounds of equipment, everything from some 600 bats and 16,800 baseballs to uniforms and weight training equipment that will travel south before returning to Washington in the beginning of April. The Nationals host the New York Yankees in an exhibition game at Nationals Park on April 4, and open the season at home against the New York Mets two days later. Most of the Nationals front office staff has already headed to Viera. The Nationals lone arbitration case of the offseason, with left-handed reliever Jerry Blevins, is due to be heard on Tuesday should the two sides be unable to come to an agreement. Blevins has asked for $2.4 million in arbitration; the Nationals have offered $2.2 million.
