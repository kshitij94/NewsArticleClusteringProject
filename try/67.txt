In the days after his death at 83, there were dozens of stories about Dean Smiths famous letters. Heres another one, courtesy of a reader named Sidney. I attended the University of Maryland as an undergrad, and despite the de rigueur animosity between theUM and UNC, I was always a Dean Smith fan, Smith e-mailed. A few monthsafter he retired I sent him a letter congratulating him on his incredible coaching career, and Coach Smith actually took the time to write me back! I thought about my letter this morning when I read all the greatthingsthat peopleare saying aboutDean Smith not just as a coach, but also as a man. Smith, youll recall, retired in the fall of 1997, which is when Sidney sent his note. Nearly a year later, the coach responded to Sidneys. Only one year later! (Ha!) the coach scribbled on the bottom of this letter.
