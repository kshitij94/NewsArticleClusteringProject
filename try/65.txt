The National Book Critics Circlehas posted a video (below) of the awards ceremony Thursday night in New York. Among the highlights: 42:15 Frank Bidarts acceptance speech for this years poetry prize for Metaphysical Dog. The celebrated poet joked that every time hes nominated for an award but doesnt win, he saves his remarks and adds a paragraph the next time. So this has gotten very long. Not really, but its very smart and very gracious. 19:00 Katherine Powerss acceptance speech for the annual award for best book criticism by an NBCC member. The Boston-based writer gave a wonderfully clear, fair and efficient description of what a book review should do and avoid. 1:06 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies sheer delight at winning the fiction prize for Americanah.
