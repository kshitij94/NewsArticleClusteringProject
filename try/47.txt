In a joint cameo appearance on the Tuesday night episode of NBCs Parks and Recreation, Sens. Orrin G. Hatch and Cory Booker invited the sitcoms protagonist, Leslie Knope, to a performance in Georgetown of their bipartisan Polynesian folk band, Across the Isle. Tickets were $8 in advance, an obviously excited Hatch told Knope. $10 at the door. Fiscal conservative I love this guy! Booker exclaimed. And as hokey as the name of their fictional act is, its actually not the worst name of a band made up of guys who make laws for their day jobs. Here are a few real-life political bands with cringe-inducing monikers: The Second Amendments This bipartisan country/rock act was named in reference to the Constitution (yep, the provision that gives Americans the right to bear arms) and as a sequel to a previous incarnation called, creatively, the Amendments. Members included drummer Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.), keyboardist Rep. Jon Porter (R-Nev.), bass player Rep. Dave Weldon (R-Fla.), guitarist Rep. Thaddeus McCotter (R-Mich.) and vocalist Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.). They broke up in 2008whenhalf the lineup lost reelection campaigns or retired. The Singing Senators The members of this GOP barbershop quartet clearly didnt agonize over what to call themselves. Founded by Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi and including former senators John Ashcroft of Missouri, James Jeffords of Vermont, and Larry Craig of Idaho, the quartet performed some surprisingly high-profile gigs, including the 1996 Republican National Convention, and even released an album. Capitol Offense Former Arkansas governorMike Huckabee played bass alongside members of his staff (get it, they all worked in the capitol?).
