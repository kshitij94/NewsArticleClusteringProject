Ship is fine minor repairs. Exciting day! pic.twitter.com/tIEctHFKHG Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2015 Musk's SpaceX has been working on building resuable rockets that it says would greatly reduce the cost of space flight. Typically, rockets are burned up and discarded after one use, which the billionaire entrepreneur has said is an unnecessary waste. Previously, SpaceX has tested short launches, with rockets blasting a few hundred feet into the air before landing softly on a landing pad. But last week's mission was the first time anyone has tried landing the first stage of a rocket on a floating barge at sea. The attempt came during an unmanned mission for NASA to resupply the International Space Station with food and supplies. After a successful launch, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket separated and then aimed for the barge, 300feet long by 170feet wide, using its engine thrust to slow down from a velocity of about 3,000mph. As the photos show, it hit hard and exploded. @ID_AA_Carmack Residual fuel and oxygen combine pic.twitter.com/5k07SP8M9n Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2015 @ID_AA_Carmack Rocket hits hard at ~45 deg angle, smashing legs and engine section pic.twitter.com/PnzHHluJfG Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2015 Musk had previously said that the "grid fins" used to help guide the rocket had run out of hydraulic fluid. On the next attempt, scheduled for later this month, the rocket will have "way more hydraulic fluid." Even though the landing wasn't successful, Musk said, it "bodes well for the future." The resupply mission, however, was successful. SpaceX's Dragon capsule docked to the space station Monday, allowing the astronauts on board to refill their cupboards.
