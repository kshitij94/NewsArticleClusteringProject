The race to fill our roads with self-driving cars continues. On Wednesday, Transport Systems Catapult, a British innovation agency, unveiled an electric self-driving vehicle that will begin transporting people around Milton Keynes, a town50 miles outside London. The car has a top speed of 15 mph and will drive on sidewalks instead of roads. Its expected to be used to ferry visitors from the train station to the heart of downtown later this year.

Passengers enter their destination on an iPad and then are on their way. While its being hyped as a self-driving car, it was built with a steering wheel, gas pedal and brake. Strangely its got a steering wheel and its supposed to be autonomous, said Jez Coates, chief engineer at Transport Systems Catapult. But you have to remember this is a development vehicle so during the development phase there will always be a safety driver in the vehicle who can take control if necessary. Eventually, he, says the steering wheel will be phased out. [RELATED: Googles self-driving car now has some new features.

Its battery range is six hours. Testing will start with just a few vehicles, but the fleet should eventually grow to around 40 vehicles, according to Transport Systems Catapult. Its unclearhow much it cost to manufacture the Lutz Pathfinder.
