For a time, it looked as if supporters of the Affordable Care Act had reasons for optimism about the laws long-term prognosis in red states, as one GOP governor after another accepted the logic of the Medicaid expansion, which promises state lawmakers huge amounts of federal dollars to improve the lives of their own constituents. But it now looks like such optimism may have been premature: That logic is hitting a wall of opposition from conservative legislators even in states where GOP governors had thrown themselves behind versions of the expansion. All this taken with the possibility that the Supreme Court could soon gut subsidies in three dozen states suggests we may be heading for deeper polarization in our health care system. The New York Times has a good overview of the developing patchwork situation on the Medicaid expansion. In states like Tennessee and Wyoming, conservative legislators have blocked the expansion pushed by GOP governors. In Utah, the GOP governor has negotiated an expansion with the Obama administration, but it faces resistance from the GOP-controlled legislature. Obamacare supporters were cheered when Indiana Governor Mike Pence offered a version of the expansion if a conservative like Pence embraced it, surely other conservatives would follow! but the fact that a similar plan died in Tennessee suggests the same fate may await it in Indiana. While its possible that Florida, Alaska, and Idaho may move forward with expansions soon, the big picture is that, if anything, the expansion is proceeding in fits and starts and may be stalling out in many places, at least for now. As it is, the refusal of many GOP states to expand Medicaid may already be increasing the polarization of the health system. Two studies released last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the refusal of GOP states to opt into the expansion risks worsening geographic disparities when it comes to health coverage, with the burden falling more heavily on southerners. But all of this could get even worse if the Supreme Court guts subsidies to millions in three dozen states. Congressional Republicans have already confirmed they wont act to fix the problem, which means any hopes of keeping the subsidies flowing would rely on the willingness of GOP governors and state legislators to set up state exchanges. Continued GOP resistance to Obamacare in the form of opposition to the Medicaid expansion obviously does not bode well in that regard. There are a number of GOP controlled states that have already expanded Medicaid, meaning they are open to accepting federal money to cover their own poorer residents, so its at least possible that a few of them might also set up exchanges so federal subsidies would also continue covering lower-income working people. But many, many red states have not opted into the Medicaid expansion, and many of those which also refrained from setting up exchanges probably wouldnt act to keep the subsidies flowing, either. Result: When it comes to access to health care, the polarization between those states and most blue ones which have expanded Medicaid and are accepting subsidies could get even deeper. ********************************************************************************* * QUOTE OF THE DAY, DEFINITION-OF-INSANITY EDITION: Republicans have hatched a brilliant new strategy to get out of the jam theyre in, now that Senate and House Republicans cant agree on how to fund the Department of Homeland Security while rolling back Obamas executive actions: Blame Democrats! Get a load of this, from Senator Mark Kirk: The Republicans if there is a successful attack during a DHS shutdown we should build a number of coffins outside each Democratic office and say, You are responsible for these dead Americans. Because blaming Dems for the shutdown worked so well last time! Unless the Court bails out Republicans by blocking Obamas actions, which could still happen, the way out is to pass a clean DHS funding bill through the House with Democratic support. * WAR AUTHORIZATION LANGUAGE LIKELY TO ANGER DEMS: Obama is set to seek Congressional authorization for the conflict against ISIS, and the language will prohibit the use of enduring offensive ground forces and limit the conflict to three years. While Republicans will probably support this, Democrats might balk: The sharpest debate is likely to focus on the prohibition of enduring offensive ground operations and whether that term is so vague that it could allow Mr. Obama or a future president to launch the kind of ground war that so many lawmakers fear. Because the president would not need to go back to Congress to seek another Islamic State force authorization until 2017, the legislation would cover the next president as well. That does seem like awfully loose language, and Democrats are likely to fear the prospect of an open-ended involvement. Of course, we should have had this debate last year, not six months after the conflict began. * HOW REPUBLICANS WILL CRITICIZE WAR AUTHORIZATION: Marco Rubio, in a radio interview that his office circulated this morning, signaled that Republicans will likely criticize the war authorization language Obama is expected to seek because it is too limiting: I hope that it is an authorization sufficient that allows us to win, to defeat ISIL. And I think when you limit it geographically, when you limit it with time constraints, youre basically telling the enemy, Were going to fight you for five years, and if in five years we havent succeeded, then were going to stop, or Were not going to hit you if you move to Libya, or if you move to Afghanistan. I dont think thats going to work if our objective here is to defeat this very dangerous group. This mission must have no geographic or chronological limits whatsoever! My guess is Republicans will still support the proposed language, with reservations, but well see. * READ THE WAR AUTHORIZATION LANGUAGE: According to NBCs Frank Thorpe, this is the draft text that the White House sent to Congress this morning. * WHAT TO WATCH TODAY: The GOP-controlled Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing on the future of Social Security Disability Insurance, and many Democrats believe Republicans are going to use DIs financial problems to launch a push for Social Security cuts, the first salvo in the broader war over the safety net that will take place in the new Congress. ICYMI: my curtain raiser is right here. * SENATE REPUBLICANS FACE TOUGH LORETTA LYNCH VOTE: The Hill reports that some Senate Republicans up for reelection in 2016 are facing a tough choice in whether to support Loretta Lynch for Attorney General: Oppose Lynch, and theyll be ignoring a sparkling performance at a Senate hearing last month that won good reviews from members of both parties, who agreed she was qualified to lead the Department of Justice. The no votes will also feed into Democratic arguments that the GOP is needlessly blocking confirmation of the first black woman to be attorney general, something that will be used against the Republican Party in 2016, when it seeks to defend 24 Senate seats. Keep in mind, these Republicans would be opposing Lynch, despite her performance and qualifications, because she supports Obamas efforts to shield millions from deportations. Meanwhile, many of them are seeking reelection in states carried by Obama. * AND DEMOCRATS MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN BIBI AND OBAMA: Roll Calls Matt Fuller takes stock of the consternation among Democrats as they try to decide what to do about Benjamin Netanyahus speech to Congress, and observes that this is starting to look like a watershed moment for Democrats who find themselves facing a choice: Side with Netanyahu, or follow the lead ofPresident Barack Obama. And this looks like a very tough choice for a lot of Democrats, even though many of them support Obamas position on the policy debate in question, i.e., whether to pass sanctions legislation now that could scuttle talks over Irans nuclear program. Meanwhile, CREDO Actions petition calling on Democrats to boycott the speech continues to gain signatures.
